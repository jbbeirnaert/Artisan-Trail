    The Artisan Trail project is a way to connect local artists with art fans.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
    The end goal of the project is to provide members of the Huntingdon
    community with a website and Android app which connect to a database of
    local art projects, performances, and events. The website and app will
    simultaneously allow for artists, event coordinators, and local business
    owners to make information on their endeavors publicaly available and easily
    accessible.

    The project is currently being developed by Juniata College
    for the Huntingdon County Visitors Bureau.
